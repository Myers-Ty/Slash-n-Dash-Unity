Tha majority of the folders and size of this project is from Edgar (The Level Generation Tool that my game utilizes). 
Some of the scripts of Edgar I altered and they can be found: COMP 296 Finished Project\Assets\Edgar\Examples\Grid2D\Gungeon\Scripts
All of the components of the project that are soley mine, programmed and devloped fully by me are found in COMP 296 Finished Project\Assets\Edgar\Examples\Grid2D\Gungeon\Mine
To run the game, use this unity scene COMP 296 Finished Project\Assets\Edgar\Examples\Grid2D\Gungeon\Gungeon.unity
